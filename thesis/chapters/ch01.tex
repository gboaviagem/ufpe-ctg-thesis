Signal processing often interweaves pure mathematics and engineering. One of its concerns is the \textit{representation} of signals (functions) and how different representations may be explored to better manipulate such signals. The spectral analysis via Fourier and similar transforms, for instance, aims to project the signal onto a domain in which the energy support is more compact (compression), or in which some frequencies are easier to be removed (filtering), or yet in which some relevant features may be created (feature engineering for machine learning problems), among others \cite{oppenheim1999discrete, rabiner2010theory, graf2015features, vergin1999generalized}.
